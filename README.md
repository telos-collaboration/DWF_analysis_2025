# DWF for Sp(4) gauge theories and Nf = 2 fundamental fermions

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and supporting files
used to analyze lattice field theory data for
DWFs + Sp(4) gauge theory with Nf = 2 fundamental fermions.
The main focus is on performing Wilson Flow analyses,
extracting masses and matrix elements from correlators,
fitting spectral properties,
and studying chiral dynamics.

## üîß Set up environments

* Download this code
* From the [data release][datarelease]
  * Download ``WF_cfgs.zip/``, and place it in ``WF_cfgs/``
  * Then, download ``cfgs.zip/`` and place it in ``cfgs/``

* Create the environment

      conda env create -f my-new-env.yml

  If you are using an Apple silicon CPU,
  ensure that you are running Conda 24.3 or later, and use the command

      conda env create -p osx-64 -f my-new-env.yml

  You can activate the environment using

      conda activate my-new-env2
